        =======
         About
        =======
        This is a Python cffi_ port of libtcod_.
        
        This library is `hosted on GitHub <https://github.com/libtcod/python-tcod>`_.
        
        Any issues you have with this module can be reported at the
        `GitHub issue tracker <https://github.com/libtcod/python-tcod/issues>`_.
        
        =======
         Usage
        =======
        This module was designed to be backward compatible with the original libtcodpy
        module distributed with libtcod.
        If you had code that runs on libtcodpy then you can use this library as a
        drop-in replacement.  This installs a libtcodpy module so you'll only need to
        delete the libtcodpy/ folder that's usually bundled in an older libtcodpy
        project.
        
        Guides and Tutorials for libtcodpy should work with the tcod module.
        
        The latest documentation can be found here:
        https://python-tcod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
        
        ==============
         Installation
        ==============
        Detailed installation instructions are here:
        https://python-tcod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
        
        For the most part it's just::
        
            pip3 install tcod
        
        ==============
         Requirements
        ==============
        * Python 3.5+
        * Windows, Linux, or MacOS X 10.9+.
        * On Windows, requires the Visual C++ runtime 2015 or later.
        * On Linux, requires libsdl2 (2.0.5+) and libomp5 to run.

        11.1.2 - 2019-08-02
        -------------------
        Changed

        -------------------
        Deprecated
         - Using an out-of-bounds index for field-of-view operations now raises a
           warning, which will later become an error.
        
        Fixed
         - Changing the tiles of an active tileset will now work correctly.
        
        11.1.0 - 2019-07-05
        -------------------
        Added

        -------------------
        Changed
         - Better runtime checks for Windows dependencies should now give distinct
           errors depending on if the issue is SDL2 or missing redistributables.
        
        Fixed
         - Changed NumPy type hints from `np.array` to `np.ndarray` which should
           resolve issues.
        
        11.0.0 - 2019-06-14
        -------------------
        Changed
         - `tcod.map.compute_fov` now takes a 2-item tuple instead of separate `x` and
           `y` parameters.  This causes less confusion over how axes are aligned.

        Changed
         - `Console.DTYPE` changed to add alpha to its color types.
        Fixed

        Fixed
         - To be more compatible with libtcodpy `tcod.console_init_root` will default

        ------------------
        Fixed

        ------------------
        Added
         - New `tcod.console.get_height_rect` function, which can be used to get the

        Fixed
         - The new print methods now handle alignment according to how they were

        ------------------
        Changed
         - New console methods now default to an `fg` and `bg` of None instead of

        Deprecated
         - Most libtcodpy console functions have been replaced by the tcod.console

         - Deprecated the `set_key_color` functions.  You can pass key colors to
           `Console.blit` instead.
         - `Console.clear` should be given the colors to clear with as parameters,
           rather than by using `default_fg` or `default_bg`.

           The new deprecation warnings will give details on how to make default values
           explicit.
        Fixed
         - `tcod.console.Console.blit` was ignoring the key color set by

        ------------------
        Changed
         - Updated libtcod to 1.10.5

        ------------------
        Deprecated
